I completed full-stack project based on a comprehensive 38.5-hour Udemy course by Murat Yücedağ, titled "Real-World BookCar with ASP.NET Core API 8.0 Onion Architecture" offered by M&Y Yazılım Eğitim Akademi Danışmanlık

The course focuses on building a Car Rental System using modern architectural patterns and technologies — and I took it as an opportunity to build something solid and real.
